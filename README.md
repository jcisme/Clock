Clock
=====
Stage 1 (April 30, 2014):

Simple prototype. Uses ACTION_TIME_TICK to receive time update broadcasts every minute.
Display is fixed, small, landscape, 12h digital only. Precision is in minutes.

Ideas for Next Stage:

- full screen (so that we can remove the redundancy of the actionbar time)
- make the digital display interesting (color, font, size, etc)
- selectable features (i.e. 12h vs 24h, color)
- analog clock
- second precision
- animation (i.e. seconds sweep, blinking dots, kit-cat clock, old-school flip digits on analog,
sand through a hour glass, etc.)
- alarm clock
- alerts on quarter hour
- sounds
- come up with a more original name than "Clock"
- check out the "competition" both on the forum and on GooglePlay
- refactor and clean-up code (i.e. MVC)
- unit testing
- publish to GooglePlay
- test on many devices
- handle portrait mode
- hybrid clock
- widget that displays time when minimized
- custom icon
